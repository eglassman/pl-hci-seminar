Why PL/HCI matters? We discussed a case study in types.

In medical infrastructure, it is essential that pipes be connected to
the right source: for example, a pipe for oxygen should deliver
oxygen. The old system was based on a color code, and it was only
enforced through human perception. The new system is based on pins,
making it impossible to connect the wrong source to a pipe. Of course,
people found ways around that through a universal adapter.

In programming languages, types are enforced by a type checker, while
the pins are enforced by their design & the laws of physics. The
equivalent of a universal adapter is a casting function from any type
to any other.
