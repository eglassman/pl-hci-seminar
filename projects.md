## Important Dates

- Dec 2 & 4: In class presentations and playable demos
- Dec 13: Written report emailed to Elena & Nada

## Guidelines

- at least 2 people, at most 5 people
- at least 1 HCI person, 1 PL person
- written communication requirement:
  * generate a report that describes the final project, structured like a research paper
  * target a venue, HCI or PL, as an exercise
- optional, but encouraged: user study? IRB approval?
- build a prototype? think what's the minimal amount of implementation or design to support your design argument?
- presentations for all the projects during class or reading period

## Deliverables

### Paper

1. A design argument

   - Need thesis and evidence collected (20%)
   - Approach thesis and evidence collected (20%)

2. A design fiction (10%)

   - Describe how a particular user runs into the obstacle and then gets around the obstacle using your designed object/language

3. Describe how you collected the evidence (10%)
4. Insights (including technical) and lessons learned (20%)
5. How would you push this project further for a research publication? (10%)

### In class

6. Playable prototype: could be paper (wizard of Oz), interactive
   prototyping tool, or partially implemented in code

## How to write a research paper

See [Simon Peyton-Jones' advice](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/How-to-write-a-great-research-paper.pdf).

- Main idea (should be useful and re-usable).
- List of contributions (should be refutable).
- Rest of paper is evidence for contributions.
- Tell a story: interesting & unsolved problem, idea, idea works, related work.
- Claims and evidence.

## Final project types

Idea and validation:
- Study and findings.
- Implementation and evaluation.
- Design and study.

## Reminder on evidence

Ways to collect evidence include but are not limited to:
- Heuristic evaluation
- Play studies with users
- Wizard of Oz studies with users
- Contextual inquiry with intended users
- Surveys
- Analysis
- Comparison
- Theorems
- Measurements
- Case studies
